# Task-1 (check master)
A menu app with billing
Hello, The above project was done using react, redux and hooks from the react-router. With everday 
updating libraries and dependencies i tried doing this project inreact-router v6 as well as new version
of redux and all but complications arrived along the way, I even started using "useNavigate" instead of
"useHistory". With the new version of reduxjs/toolkit, I couldnt access or use createStore and while searching 
for its solution i found that this new update was just released and there less to none solutions. So, ended up
doing in the older version overall i know the overflow of the app and the redux as well as hooks used.
